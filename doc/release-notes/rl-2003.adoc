=== State Version Changes

The state version in this release includes the changes below. These
changes are only active if the `home.stateVersion` option is set to
"20.03" or later.

* The <<opt-programs.zsh.history.path>> option is no longer prepended
  by `$HOME`, which allows specifying absolute paths, for example,
  using the xdg module. Also, the default value is fixed to
  `$HOME/.zsh_history` and `dotDir` path is not prepended to it
  anymore.
